# Temp Voice Discord Bot

Source code for the bot on my Discord server hosted on Autocode. It features the creation of temporary channels when a user joins a lobby voice channel. Once they are empty, the temporary channels are removed automatically.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project was originally made on a bot hosting website called Autocode which has shut down since April 26th, 2024.
